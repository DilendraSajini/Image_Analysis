Leveraging Deep Learning and Medical Image Analysis for Enhanced Breast Cancer Diagnosis

Deep Learning (DL) has has brought remarkable advancements to the field of medical image analysis, introducing algorithms like CNN, RNN, and GAN. These algorithms aim to enhance the precision of cancer diagnostics and reduce errors. In the context of breast cancer histopathological images, this study explores various strategies to boost classification accuracy.
Traditionally, the scientific community expended substantial effort constructing deep learning models from the ground up. Yet, the landscape has evolved with the rise of transfer learning models, streamlining and optimizing resource use. This acceleration is augmented by integrating a patch-based approach that efficiently handles individual patches, leading to better accuracy, faster processing, and scalability in image analysis tasks. Adding LSTM networks to this approach overcomes patch classification limitations by capturing temporal connections between patches, compensating for anatomical context gaps. This comprehensive approach encourages swift experimentation, allowing exploration of diverse ideas while efficiently utilizing computational resources. The objective remains to achieve higher accuracy in a condensed time frame through efficient resource use and techniques like transfer learning, precise data preprocessing, hyperparameter tuning, and data augmentation.
The proposed model adopts a shallow network; do not require heavy training to train hundreds of layers. It seamlessly merges transfer learning using pre-trained VGG16 and LSTM, capitalizing on their unique strengths. It focuses on binary classification of benign and malignant images from the BreakHis dataset, encompassing 2480 benign and 5429 malignant cancer images across various magnifications. The model adeptly accommodates diverse image sizes, including high-resolution histology images, through a patch-based approach. The experimental outcomes showcase a pinnacle achievement of 90.81% Accuracy on the 100x dataset, coupled with 88.40% Precision, 95.59% Recall, and a leading AUC value of 93.84 at 100X magnifications. The utilization of patch-based training has significantly elevated accuracy when compared to the conventional WSI classification approach. Concurrently, the integration of LSTM has further augmented accuracy beyond what standalone dense layers can achieve. This underscores the critical role of both patch-based training and LSTM in enhancing the accuracy and efficacy of the model. In conclusion, this study not only underscores DL's potential in medical image analysis but also introduces a refined approach that combines diverse techniques for optimal accuracy and efficiency.
